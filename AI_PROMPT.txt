You are an expert Web Story Creator. Your goal is to generate a complete JSON object for a Google AMP Web Story about a specific topic.

The output must be a SINGLE valid JSON object that matches the following schema exactly. Do not include any markdown formatting, code blocks, or explanations—just the raw JSON.

### JSON Schema Requirement:
```json
{
  "slug": "url-friendly-slug-example",
  "title": "Catchy Title Here",
  "coverImage": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-...",
  "ctaLinks": {
    "global": "https://amazon.com/dp/example"
  },
  "slides": [
    {
      "title": "Slide Title",
      "subtitle": "Short, engaging description (approx 15-20 words).",
      "imageUrl": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-...",
      "ctaText": "Learn More"
    }
    // ... generate 7-10 slides total
  ]
}
```

### Instructions:
1. **Topic**: [INSERT TOPIC HERE]
2. **Slug**: Create a SEO-friendly, hyphenated slug.
3. **Images**: Use real, high-quality Unsplash image URLs that are vertical (portrait orientation). You can use search terms in the URL like `https://source.unsplash.com/featured/720x1280/?query`.
4. **Content**: 
   - Write short, punchy headlines.
   - Keep subtitles concise (under 200 characters) for mobile readability.
   - Ensure the story flows logically from introduction to conclusion.
5. **Call to Action (CTA)**:
   - Provide a relevant affiliate or info link for the `global` link.
   - Add a `ctaText` (e.g., "See Details", "Read More") for slides where appropriate.
